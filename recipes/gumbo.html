            <h2>How to make New Orleans Creole Gumbo</h2>
                <h3>Step 1.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup 
                        bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over 
                        medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking 
                        constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown 
                        color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat 
                        carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. 
                        Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture 
                        stops cooking.
                    </p>
                <h3>Step 2.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell 
                        pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food 
                        processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very 
                        finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and
                        mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over 
                        medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are 
                        tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and 
                        set aside.
                    </p>
                <h3>Step 3.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large 
                        Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over 
                        medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes 
                        dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling 
                        water.
                    </p>
                <h3>Step 4.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt,
                         hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, 
                         thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer
                          soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons
                          of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.
                    </p>
                <h3>Step 5.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a 
                        skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and 
                        cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, 
                        and stir into the simmering gumbo.
                    </p>
                <h3>Step 6.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and 
                        Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors 
                        have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more 
                        teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.
